        <h2>How Weight and Mass Work</h2>
        <p>Mass and weight are both important concepts in physics, and understanding the difference between them is essential to understanding how objects behave in different environments.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Mass?</h3>
        <p>Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. It is a scalar quantity, which means that it only has magnitude and no direction. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). Mass is a fundamental property of matter, and it does not change with the object's location, temperature, or any other external factor.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Weight?</h3>
        <p>Weight is the force exerted on an object due to the gravitational attraction of another object. The SI unit of weight is the newton (N). Weight is a vector quantity, which means that it has both magnitude and direction. The direction of weight is always towards the center of the attracting object, which is usually the Earth.</p>
        
        <h3>How is Weight Calculated?</h3>
        <p>The weight of an object can be calculated using the formula:</p>
        <div class="formula">W = mg</div>
        <p>where W is the weight of the object, m is its mass, and g is the gravitational acceleration. The value of g is approximately 9.8 m/s^2 on the surface of the Earth. However, the value of g can vary depending on the object's distance from the center of the Earth and the object's mass.</p>
        
        <h3>Gravitational Force</h3>
        <p>The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula for the gravitational force is:</p>
        <div class="formula">F = G(m1 x m2) / r^2</div>
        <p>where F is the gravitational force, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, r is the distance between their centers of mass, and G is the gravitational constant. The value of G is approximately 6.67 x 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2. The gravitational force is always attractive and acts in the direction between the two objects.</p>
